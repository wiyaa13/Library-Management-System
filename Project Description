# Library Management System
This application is a complete solution to help libraries improve daily operations. 
It offers a centralized platform for the management of various library materials, such as multimedia, books, journals, and user data.
In our project, we are focusing on several features such as renting and ordering books checking in and checking out the book.
It is also an application that can help arrange user information and book information in an efficient way.
It also helps a user to lend a book and keep track of a book that has been borrowed.
It also stores book information for a user to check the author or  type of genre for a user to select a book based on their preference.
